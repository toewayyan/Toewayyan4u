<h1 style="color:Tomato;" align="middle">What is a power supply?</h1>
<p align="middle">Do not confuse a power supply with a power source. The source is the origin of incoming electricity.<br>
 In most cases, the electricity source is an outlet, battery, or generator. The power supply works to convert <br>
 the power from the source into the correct format and voltage. Because a variety of options exist, the specific power<br>
  supply function depends on whether it needs to regulate energy or convert power. To understand a power supply and how it works,<br>
   you must know its parts and their contributions to the device’s operation, which is discussed below.</p>

</table>
<p align="middle">Power supplies have essential functions found in all models with additional operations added depending on the device type. Power supplies may need to change voltage up or down, convert power to direct current, or regulate power for smoother outcoming voltage. These functions will help you choose which supply you need for your electrical needs. Getting a device with too many features could cost you more money than you need to spend, but if you don’t get the features you require, you could damage the devices you need to power.</p>

<br><h1 align="middle">What is a motherboard?</h1><br><p align="middle">
A motherboard is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in a computer.<br>
 The motherboard is a computer's central communications backbone connectivity<br>
  point, through which all components and external peripherals connect.<br>

Motherboards can be found in virtually all computers, especially desktop <br>
and laptop PCs. The components that connect through them include chipsets,Mbr><br> central processing units (CPU) and memory. The external peripherals include <br>Wi-Fi, Ethernet and graphics cards with the graphics processing unit, or GPU.<br>

Motherboard manufacturers include Acer, ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte Technology, Intel and Micro-Star International.</p>
<h1 align="middle">How does a motherboard work?</h1><BR><img src="typical_motherboard_configuration-f.png" align="middle" width="1500">
<p align="middle">The PCB of a large motherboard may include six to 14 layers of fiberglass,<br>
 copper connecting traces and copper planes for power and signal isolation. Other <br>
 <br>components get added to a motherboard through expansion slots. These include<br>
  processor sockets; dual in-line memory modules; Peripheral Component Interconnect<br>
   (PCI), PCI Express (PCIe) and solid-state drive M.2 slots; as well as power supply connections.</p>

   <p align="middle">A central processing unit (CPU)<q> is a hardware component that’s the core computational<br> 
   unit in a server. Servers and other smart devices convert data into digital signals<br>
    and perform mathematical operations on them. The CPU is the primary component that,<br>
     processes the signals and makes computing possible. It acts as the brain of any<br>
      computing device. It fetches instructions from memory, performs the required tasks,<br>
       and sends output back to memory. It handles all computing tasks required for running the<br>
        operating system and applications.</q></p>

         At their core, they use the same set of processes. These processes are<br>
          called the fetch-execute cycle. This cycle has three steps: fetch; decode; and <br>execute.</p>

          <p align="middle">A memory module, also known as a RAM module, is a small circuit<br>
                            board that contains a number of memory chips. These chips are used<br>
                             to store data that is currently being used by the computer’s central processing<br>
                              unit (CPU). Memory modules are an essential component of any computer system and play<br>
                               a vital role in determining the overall performance of the system.

<h1 align="middle">How does a ram moduels work?</h1>
<table width="1500px"><img src="DIMMs.jpg" width="1500px" height="400px"></table>
<p align="middle">Memory module types work by allowing the CPU to access data quickly and efficiently.<br>
 When the CPU needs to read or write data, it sends a request to the memory module. The memory module<br>
  then retrieves the data from the memory chips and sends it back to the CPU. This process happens very quickly,<br>
   allowing the CPU to access data in a matter of nanoseconds.<br>

There are several different types of memory modules, including Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), Static Random<br>
 Access Memory (SRAM), and Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM). Each type of memory module has its own unique<br>
  characteristics and is designed for specific purposes.<br>
DRAM is the most common type of memory module and is used in most personal computers. It is a type of volatile memory,<br>
 which means that it requires power to retain data. When the computer is turned off, the data stored in DRAM is lost.<br>

SRAM is another type of volatile memory, but it is much faster than DRAM. SRAM is used in cache memory, which is a type <br>
of memory that is used to store frequently accessed data. Because SRAM is so fast, it allows the CPU to access data much more <br>
quickly than it would be able to with DRAM.<br>

SDRAM is a type of memory module that is synchronized with the system clock. This allows the CPU to access data more quickly and<br>
 efficiently than it would be able to with other types of memory modules. SDRAM is commonly used in high-performance computers,<br>
  such as gaming computers and workstations.</p>

<table>
  <h1 align="middle">What is a optical drive?</h1>
  <p align="middle">An optical drive is a computer accessory that allows you to read to<br>
   and write from optical discs using a laser or visible light.<br>
The most common optical media are Compact Discs (CDs), Digital Video<br>
 Discs or Digital Versatile Discs (DVDs), and Blu-ray Discs (BDs).<br>

An optical drive could be a CD drive, DVD drive, or a BD drive. Some common<br>
 uses of optical drives are watching movies on a DVD, listening to music on CDs,<br>
  installing software, playing games, and backing up data.<br>

Note that a CD drive can only access CDs, a DVD drive can access CDs and DVDs,<br>
 while a BD drive can access CDs, DVDs, and BDs. But all these drives are collectively<br>
  referred to as optical drives.</p>

  <table width="1500px"><img  src="pcw12_Hitachi_ODD.webp" width="1500px" height="400px"></table>
  <p align="middle">In all three disc formats, data is encoded in flat areas and hollows and stored in<br>
   spiral tracks on circular disks. The flat areas are known as lands and represent “1”,<br>
    and the hollows are called pits and represent “0”. A low-power blue-violet laser beam reads the pits.<br>
     The laser is reflected back with different intensities and is converted by a photodiode sensor to electric 0’s and 1’s.<br>

Optical drives are named so because they use light, in the form of lasers, to access the data on the discs.</p>

<p align="middle">A hard drive is the hardware component that stores all of your digital content.<br>
   Your documents, pictures, music, videos, programs, application preferences, and operating<br>
    system represent digital content stored on a hard drive. Hard drives can be external or internal.<br>


Everything stored on a hard drive is measured in terms of its file size.<br>
 Documents (text) are generally very small whereas pictures are large, music is even larger,<br>
  and videos are the largest. A hard drive determines the size of digital files in terms of megabytes<br>
   (MB), gigabytes (GB), and terabytes (TB).1</p>

   	                 components by letting it rise through a series of fins. <br>
                     By themselves, heat sinks are passive, meaning they have<br>
                     no moving parts. In most cases, however, the heatsink is<br>
                     combined with a fan that blows the hot air away or a liquid<br>
                     cooling solution that carries the heat halfway through the pipes. </p>

                     <p align="middle"> A heat sink makes use of the principles of conductive,<br>
                      convective, and radiative heat transfer to move heat from a hotter source<br>
                       to a lower-temperature fluid. Heat is conducted from this source into the<br>
                        sink. Heat sinks are produced from materials with a large heat capacity,<br>
                         i.e. they can store more heat per gram of material. This heat then transfers<br>
                          from the sink into the surrounding fluid via convection and radiation. The heat<br>
                           transfer rate is increased by having a large surface area in contact with the heat<br>
                            exchange fluid. Surface area can be dramatically increased by cutting fins into the<br>
                             heat sink base material. <br>
                             A heat sink may be passive or active. An active heat sink makes useof the forced convection<br>
                              created by a fan or pump to rapidly transfer heat from the device, while a passive heat sink<br>
                               makes use of natural convection</p>
